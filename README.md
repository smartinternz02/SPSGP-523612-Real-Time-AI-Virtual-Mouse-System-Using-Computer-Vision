Assignment 1
Pandas Data Manipulation Basics

Assignment 2
Build an ANN model for Drug classification.
This project aims to analyze the relationship between various medical parameters and drug effectiveness. The dataset consists of patient information,
including age, sex, blood pressure levels (BP), cholesterol levels, sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na_to_K), drug type, and corresponding labels. The goal is to
develop a model that can accurately predict the class or category of a given drug based on its features.

Task 1: Read the dataset and do data pre-processing
Task 2: Build the ANN model with (input layer, min 3 hidden layers & output layer)
Task 3: Test the model with random data

Assignment 3:
Build a CNN model for Bird species
Bird species classification is the process of using machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify and categorize different species of birds based
on their visual characteristics. By analyzing images of birds, models can extract features and patterns to accurately classify bird species. This classification is
vital for ecological research, wildlife monitoring, and conservation efforts. Advancements in deep learning and the availability of large annotated datasets have
improved the accuracy of bird species classification models. Challenges include variations in lighting, pose, and background clutter. Ongoing research
focuses on methods like transfer learning and data augmentation to enhance classification performance and contribute to avian biodiversity understanding
and conservation.
