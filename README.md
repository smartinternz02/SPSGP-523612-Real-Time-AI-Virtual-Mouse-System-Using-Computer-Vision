Assignment 1
Pandas Data Manipulation Basics

Assignment 2
Build an ANN model for Drug classification.
This project aims to analyze the relationship between various medical parameters and drug effectiveness. The dataset consists of patient information,
including age, sex, blood pressure levels (BP), cholesterol levels, sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na_to_K), drug type, and corresponding labels. The goal is to
develop a model that can accurately predict the class or category of a given drug based on its features.
